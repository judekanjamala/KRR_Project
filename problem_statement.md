# Problem-5: Backward Chaining

Implement a Prolog-like backward chaining system using a depth-first strategy. Accept rules
from a text file (as per the language specification) and convert them into XML. Accept the goal
from a similar file. Show the final proof for the goal (if possible, graphically as a tree). One
should be able to opt for more than one solution on giving a goal. Allow the use of Cut. The
algorithm should output either a substitution or FALSE, along with a trace in a text file.
